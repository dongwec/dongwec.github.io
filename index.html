        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics at Colorado State University. I am working in mathematical analysis, with research at the intersection of analysis, probability, and signal processing. I frequently use probabilistic tools to investigate signal reconstruction and complex systems, with applications in renewable energy, atmospheric turbulence, and climate science. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Clemson University. My postdoc mentors are Dr. Clayton Shonkwiler and Dr. Emily King. My PhD mentor is Dr. Martin Schmoll. 
          
          A central theme of my research is the use of optimal transport to address problems in signal processing. I am particularly interested in the theory of probabilistic frames. Frames are the generalization of orthonormal bases in Hilbert spaces and have applications in signal processing. Probabilistic frames further generalize frames by interpreting them as discrete probability measures. This probabilistic viewpoint opens the door to a rich interaction between frame theory and tools from probability and optimal transport. While many aspects of frame theory have been studied using analytic and algebraic techniques, their counterparts in the probabilistic setting remain unexplored. My goal is to build a bridge between the optimal transport and frame theory communities to study such questions in a new light.
          
          In addition to this central research program, I maintain active interests in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and other application areas, including climate data analysis and wind and solar power modeling. These problems motivate the development of new algorithms and the applications of new mathematical techniques, such as optimal transport.
